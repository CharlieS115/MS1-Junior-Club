### Issues found and fixes

All issues were found using google inspect and the responsive design tools.

* Overflowing Content triggering a x axis scroll bar.

This was happening due to Bootstraps .row margin having a -15px setting. To correct this I styled the .row class with a margin of 0. 

* Invisible hamburger menu.

The hamburger menu was active as you could see it highlight on google inpect when hovered over. To fix this the navbar-dark class was added to make this visable. Bootstrap CDN helped find the solution.

* Download button wasn't responding with colour change until the letters were hovered over.

This was an issue as clicking the button did nothing but clicking the letters linked to the pdf. This was fixed by adding padding to the a element to cover the button.

* Navbar title 'Junior Club' wasn't linking back to the home page.

This issue was caused by a typo in the href element.

* 3rd testimonials quote was displaying out of line on both the x and y axis.

This was a due to the class being set to col-sm-12. This was corrected by changing the class to col-12.

* Fixed issue where html wasn't passing validation as a element was inside button element.

Moved the classes from the button element to the a element then removed button element. Moved all the atributes from .activity-schedule button in css into the .activity-schedule a and a:hover classes.
