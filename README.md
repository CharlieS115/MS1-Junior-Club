## Testing

---

### Functionality Testing

I used google chrome developer tools throughtout the project to text everything as I was working on it.

Tested:

#### Responsiveness

Expected - The site is expected to respond to different screen sizes.

Testing - Tested this by expanding and contracting the windown size inside google inspect.

Result- Site responded as expected to all screen sizes 320px and up.

#### Navbar links

Expected - Navbar links and title will direct to the respective page and the title will act as an additional home link.

Testing - Clicked on all the links inside each page.

Result - All navbar elements working.

#### Test text to background colour contrast

Expected - it's expected that their is a clear contrast between text colour and background color throught the site.

Testing - Used google select to hover over all texts and check contrast is ticked. Also read everything to check it was all clearly visable.

Result - All text has a good contrast between itself and background color.

#### Buttons

Expected - Buttons will direct the user to the desired outcome in this case a pdf document for the download now button and a sign up modal for the sign up button.

Testing - Clicked on the buttons to see what happened. Also checked the :hover class was working when moving on and off the buttons.

Result- All buttons responded as expected.

#### Social Links

Expected - To be directed to the respective site.

Testing - Clicked on all social links to see where they linked to. Also checked the :hover pseudo element is working by hovering on and off the links.

Result - All links responded as expected and linked to the appropriate sites.

Expected - To be linked to the event organisers site.

Testing - Clicked on a link to see where it linked to. Also checked the :hover pseudo element is working by hovering on and off the link.

Result - Links Respond as expected and link to the event organiser sites.

#### Tested Navbar responsiveness

Expected - Navbar items will stay inline fit within the page.

Testing - Tested this by expanding and contracting the windown size inside google inspect.

Result - Did not respond as expected on screen widths from 576px to 608px. The navbar links would squash the Junior Club title due to lack of spacing.

Fix - Changed the nav links padding to allow for more room.

#### Tested Modals

### Issues and bugs

All issues and bugs were found using google inspect and the responsive design tools. 

Below I have explaing the issue and how they were resolved:

* Overflowing Content triggering a x axis scroll bar.

This was happening due to Bootstraps .row margin having a -15px setting. To correct this I styled the .row class with a margin of 0. 

* Invisible hamburger menu.

The hamburger menu was active as you could see it highlight on google inpect when hovered over. To fix this the navbar-dark class was added to make this visable. Bootstrap CDN helped find the solution.

* Download button wasn't responding with colour change until the letters were hovered over.

This was an issue as clicking the button did nothing but clicking the letters linked to the pdf. This was fixed by adding padding to the a element to cover the button.

* Navbar title 'Junior Club' wasn't linking back to the home page.

This issue was caused by a typo in the href element.

* 3rd testimonials quote was displaying out of line on both the x and y axis.

This was a due to the class being set to col-sm-12. This was corrected by changing the class to col-12.

* Fixed issue where html wasn't passing validation as a element was inside button element.

Moved the classes from the button element to the a element then removed button element. Moved all the atributes from .activity-schedule button in css into the .activity-schedule a and a:hover classes.

## Credits

To complete this project I used Code Institute student template: [gitpod full template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

### Learning resources and styling ideas

Throughtout learning with code institute I have researched and learn't using the following site and courses:

* [Code Institue](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/login?next=/dashboard)
    * Throughout this project I have refered back to lots of different moduls to refresh myself on good practices.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
    * I have used this site throughout the course when looking for ideas or potential stylings to code.
* [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
    * I have occasional visted this site for ideas and potential fixes throughout the course.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    * Throughtout this project I have visted this site many time to create the pages structure and give ideas and coding examples.
    * I have also read up on ever class I have used to understand exactly what it will do to the site when used.
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    * I have visted this site a few times throughtout the course however I have avoided it whilst building this site as I wanted to workout how to do most of the code myself and not just see fixes.
* [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
    * I have not visted this site recently however this is where I first started learning to code.

### Code

I have tried to do almost all the code and styling myself through trial and error and using google inspect.

Below are the exaples of code I have copied to complete this project:

* [Bootstrap - Modal](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/modal/)
    * The modal was originally copied from bootstrap library. This modal has been heavily modified.

## Other information

---

### Git commits

There Github commit on February 1st saying 'http.server' was not intend to be submit wih this message so I done another commit with the message 'added event two and styled. websites at the bottom of section linked to the event organisers home page.' which was the intended message for this commit.

### Wireframe Design Changes

Below I have listed the major change to the finish project structure from the wireframes and why.

* About us section added
    * This section was added as having this information split up and in other section made it difficult for users to get a full picture.

* Schedule of events
    * Put the schedule of events inside a table instead of events tiles to make the information easier to breakdown and acquire. The tile approach was tried in a seperate repository but did not have an appealing look.

* Event Listings 
    * One image per listing instead of multiple. This was because the screen seemed too crowed with more than one image. This was also tried in a seperate repository.

* Events and Gallery titles
    * Page width images with a title incased were added to provide consitancy throughout the site.

* Events
    * Schedule wasn't added as there is an activity schedule on the home page and I wanted to reserve the events page for events and camps.

* Gallery
    * Decided to go with images all of the same size with spacing as I thought this looked better then images of all diffrent sizes side by side.

### Social links

The social links are linked to the social platforms home page until accounts for Junior Club are set up.

### Reasons for coding format

I have chosen to write slightly more CSS than is need as I have tried give every HTML section its own independent section of CSS instead of just styling all similar elements like the h2, h3, i and p elements once. I have done this to help maintain the structure and styling of the site even if a section is drastically changed or deleted in the future. This will also help if sections are to be moved to a different page or a different repository as you can cut out the section in HTML and the respective section in CSS.
